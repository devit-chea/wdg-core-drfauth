Utils:
=====

Purpose:
    Utility functions are generally small,
    self-contained functions that perform
    a specific task and can be reused across
    different parts of the application.

Characteristics:
    1. Generic: They usually do not depend on the business logic of the application.
    2. Reusability: Can be easily reused in different contexts.

    Examples: String manipulation functions, date and time utilities, common math operations.
